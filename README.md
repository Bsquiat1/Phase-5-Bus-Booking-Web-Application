# Bus Management Web App - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the Bus Management Web Application. This backend system powers the core functionalities of the web app, providing APIs for user authentication, bus management, scheduling, and communication between different roles in the system.

## Project Overview

- Bus owners/drivers can schedule bus trips and add prices per seat
- Customers can book seats based on bus availability and manage their bookings
- Integration with email services to send booking tickets to customers
- Integration with mobile money payment system for seamless payments
